## PROBLEM AND DEFINITION
Currently the health care system has several problems.
-There is no mechanism for dr.s to look at a patient’s complete history
-It is difficult to move records from state to state or country to country
-Individuals don’t have control over their own health information
-It is hard for people to educate themselves about their own health
-Understanding a diagnosis and seeking further opinions is usually difficult
-Not all dr’s  have compatible systems to view different types of data/files
-How do you know what your doctor has trained in and how do they compare to other doctors or other therapies.
-Do you feel alone in the search for answers
-How do you find support groups and community help
-Where do you find all the tools/software to review all the types of scans and files
-How do you find healthcare providers to review your case. 
-Billing and insurance can be a problem when moving interstate or internationally’
-How do you pay for services internationally
-How do you know who to trust.
